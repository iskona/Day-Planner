# Day-Planner

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Moment.js

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app displays standard business hours from 9AM to 5PM. Each time slot represents one hour and contains the following:

* The time

* A field to hold the input

* A save button

Clicking on the save button stores the time and the input in `localStorage`.

Near the top of the calendar, the application displays the current day. Additionally, each hour is color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, present, or future. This will change depending on the time of day.
